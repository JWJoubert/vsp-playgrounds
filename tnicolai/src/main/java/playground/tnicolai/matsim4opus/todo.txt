Todos:


- MATSimZone: test or implement controllers
- test different beta values
- test accessibility measure paired with workers or 1-person hh or income in UrbanSim
- implement interface for SpatialGrid Interpolation (for returning accessibility values for each parcel)
- re-implement SpatialGrid: use 2d array of doubles instead of Object
- make "opportunity" sampling rate configurable 

Tasks Done:
- implement ZoneBasedAccessibilityControlerListenerV2 (see Cell-Based approach ...)
- implement controller for agent-based performance feedback (time spent traveling, money spent traveling, etc.)
- orthogonal mapping of measuring points, i.e. othog. walk time from point2Link + walk or car travel time from link intersection 2 nearest node
	- test why plots of this implementation looks wired -> solved :-) prevoius implementation wasn't correct
- MATSimZone: implement "get_matsim_data_into_urbansim" -> using a common module for UrbanSim parcel and zone since one zone data is return by now from MATSim (works for both cases)
- implement normal MATSim config as input
- Brussel scenario: matching coordinates of zone centroids and network -> created new network with right projection
- re-implement: determine measuring point to process via cell centroid and not the left bottom corner (shapefiles)

Fixed errors:
- Error while importing Brussels travel_data into UrbanSim -> Problem solved, the "travel_data" dataset was empty. Just imported the travel_data.csv output from MATSim
