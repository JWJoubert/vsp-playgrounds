Ideas / To-Do's
***************************************

- paint uncomplete links/ways (e.g. null values in freespeed etc.) in a different manner
- merge networks
- finish working filters for exports
- create/draw reverse direction for ways
- visualize other attributes (capacity, freespeed, ...) than the id on ways (selectable as option)
- visualize shortest path from one node to another 
- length handling of links / ways - real-time-update?
- show (possible) matsim links on osm-maps
