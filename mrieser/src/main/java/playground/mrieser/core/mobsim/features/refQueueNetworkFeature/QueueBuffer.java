/**
 * The "buffer" contains those vehicles that are allowed to leave a link. A
 * {@link QueueNode} will check the buffer of each incoming link to see if there
 * are vehicles that need to be moved.
 *
 * <h3>Calculation of buffer-capacity</h3>
 * <p>(Flow)Capacity for the buffer is defined as an amount of vehicles,
 * which can leave the buffer per timestep. Each second, this amount is
 * available. Assuming this flowCapacity contains fractional parts, these
 * fractional parts need to be summed up (accumulated) over multiple time
 * steps, until probably they sum up to allow an additional vehicle to
 * pass. Thus, the available space in the buffer can be calculated as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>flowCapacity: defines how much capacity is newly available in each timestep.
 * This is typically fixed for the whole simulation, and can be splitted into an
 * integer part and a fractional part</li>
 * <li>bufferCap: the capacity available in the current timestep. Initialized to
 * the integer part of flowCapacity at the beginning of each timestep. If
 * bufferCap >= 1.0, a vehicle can pass.</li>
 * <li>bufferCapAccumulate: Accumulation of fractional parts of flowCapacity. If
 * bufferCapAccumulate >= 1.0, an additional vehicle can pass. bufferCapAccumulate
 * is increased in each timestep by the fractional part of flowCapacity, until
 * bufferCapAccumulate >= 1.0.
 * </ul>
 * Whenever a vehicle is added to the buffer, is uses up some of the capacity. Thus,
 * the capacity consumed by the vehicle (see {@link MobsimVehicle#getSizeInEquivalents()})
 * is subtracted from either bufferCap or bufferCapAccumulate. If it is a large vehicle
 * (consuming more capacity than 1 standard vehicle), it may happen that bufferCap gets
 * negative. In this case, bufferCap is set to zero, but the missing difference is
 * subtracted from bufferCapAccumulate, leading to a possibly negative
 * bufferCapAccumulate. When a new timestep starts, and bufferCapAccumulate is negative,
 * bufferCap is initialied with zero, and the full flowCapacity is added to
 * bufferCapAccumulate.</p>
 * <p>
 * Thus, one could think of the variables in the following way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>flowCapacity: defines how much capacity is newly available in each timestep.</li>
 * <li>bufferCap: capacity newly available in current timestep</li>
 * <li>bufferCapAccumulate: compensating capacity amount for fractional parts of
 * flowCapacity and pre-used capacity by large vehicles</li>
 * <li>bufferCap + bufferCapAccumulate: effectively available flow capacity in current timestep.
 * If the sum >= 1.0, vehicles can leave the link (and thus be added to the buffer).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
