This parser has been adapted from the parser found at:
https://github.com/darius/expr
======================
The usage of the parser has been simplified:

Parser parser=new Parser("x+1.0");
parser.setVariable("x", 1);
double result=parser.parse();
should give 2.0
========================
The same parser can be used multiple times with different variables.
