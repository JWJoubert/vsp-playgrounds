For starting a run only based on a given event file (for dumb charging without feedback), 
use the following configuration:

- before you can run playground.wrashid.PSF2.chargingSchemes.dumbCharging.testEventFileBased(), 
you need to change the content of the input config file (test/input/playground/wrashid/PSF2/chargingSchemes/dumbCharging/config-event-file-based.xml)
as follows:
	- adapt the plans, facilities and input plans file. facilities file only needed, if used for scenario.
	- also set the property: main.inputEventsForSimulationPath
	- actually the rest of the content of this file is ignored (should be just run 1 iteraion! => else need to adapt it)
