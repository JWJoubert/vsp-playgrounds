/**
 * This experiment clearly shows, that if we form three groups, the walking
 * distance and score of the groups are different. - and ordered as we would
 * expect.
 * 
 * - point out, why there is a rise in walking distance in the beginning. -
 * point out, why difference between waling distance of group1-group2 is larger
 * than group2-group3 (because the number of parkings increases with bigger
 * radius, that difference is not that important anymore.
 * 
 * 
 * - change the number of parkings and see, what happens (in general the walking
 * distance should decrease).
 * 
 * - change the access time of the closest facilities to home and work => their
 * attractivness should decrease (resulting in longer walking times).
 * 
 * - increase the price of the closest parking: have different groups with
 * different incomes (they should be picket at random, to solve the bias of
 * having an arrival advantage - e.g. select the agents with even ids). -
 * => the agents with higher income should have shorter walking distances.
 * - 
 * 
 * - compare scenarios with 100000 agents and increase parking capacities =>
 * find out, in how many iterations the system finds a proper solution.
 * 
 * 
 * - reason, why there is so much change in the average travel distance: too much of replanning done
 *  and only parking replanning turned on.
 *  
 * - one can see, that the advantage of arriving early (and therefore an advantage regarding the capacity
 * constraint can be established almost immediatly (within the first 5 iterations).
 * 
 * - we can for clarity show in the beginning with only two groups and later with 3 groups.
