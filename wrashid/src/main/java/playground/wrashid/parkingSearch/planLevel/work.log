TODO:

1.) add scoring
2.) add proper replanning module for parking (2 possibilites)
	- do this e.g. by watching playground examples for replanning.
3.) add tests (assert statements)
4.) add per agent utility functions.










1.) A facilities file was generated at 
/playgrounds/wrashid/test/input/playground/wrashid/parkingSearch/planLevel/berlinFacilities.xml
(each node was assigned a parking lot of capacity 67). => 2 times the number of links (no problem). 
These parkings are all assigned a constant capacity.


- Keep track of occupancy at the parkings - This is needed for the replanning. 
Think, backwards from replanning, what is needed there and then continue this.

- How to find all parkings belonging to a link? Mainain a map, 
which gives for a linkId the corresponding parking facilities (ids). 
see what is really needed in this regard.
