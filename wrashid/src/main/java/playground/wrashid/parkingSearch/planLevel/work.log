TODO:

1.) add scoring
2.) add proper replanning module for parking (2 possibilites)
	- do this e.g. by watching playground examples for replanning.
3.) add tests (assert statements)
4.) add per agent utility functions.










1.) A facilities file was generated at 
/playgrounds/wrashid/test/input/playground/wrashid/parkingSearch/planLevel/berlinFacilities.xml
(each node was assigned a parking lot of capacity 67). => 2 times the number of links (no problem). 
These parkings are all assigned a constant capacity.
