	 * Idea:
	 * MATSim Routers create Routes for complete plans.
	 * We just want to replan the Route from one Activity to another one, so we create
	 * a new Plan that contains only this Route. This Plan is replanned by sending it
	 * to the Router.
	 *
	 * Attention! The Replanner is started when the Activity of a Person ends and the Vehicle 
	 * is added to the Waiting List of its QueueLink. That means that a Person replans 
	 * his Route at time A but enters the QueueLink at time B.
	 * A short example: If all Persons of a network end their Activities at the same time 
	 * and have the same Start- and Endpoints of their Routes they will all use the same
	 * route (if they use the same router). If they would replan their routes when they really
	 * Enter the QueueLink this would not happen because the enter times would be different
	 * due to the limited number of possible vehicles on a link at a time. An implementation
	 * of such a functionality would be a problem due to the structure of MATSim...
