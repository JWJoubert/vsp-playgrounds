 * The CurrentLegReplanner can be used while an Agent travels from
 * one Activity to another one.
 *
 * MATSim Routers use Plan as Input Data. To be able to use them, we have to create
 * a new Plan from the current Position to the location of the next Activity.
 *
 * This Replanner is called, if a person is somewhere on a Route between two Activities.
 * First the current Route is splitted into two parts - the already passed links and
 * the ones which are still to go.
 * Next a new Plan is created with an Activity at the current Position and an Endposition
 * that is equal to the one from the original plan.
 * This Plan is handed over to the Router and finally the new route is merged with the
 * Links that already have been passed by the Person.
